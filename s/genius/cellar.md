# ðŸªœ Cellar

A virtual filesystem for the web.

Cellar provides primitives for building intuitive file browsing experiences on the web.
- Agnostic about where data is actually stored
- For local, best to use [Cask](./cask.md) as an OPFS turbocharger

> Cellar is like a souped-up extended opfs.  

Cellar stores two kinds of data:
- **Blob storage**  
  Stores the binary payloads for files.  
  Usually, blob storage will target *opfs* â€” though localstorage, indexeddb, or cloud storage are options.  
  sha256 hashes are the identifiers, thus binary payloads are thus de-duplicated.  
- **Index storage**  
  Stores metadata and directory hierarchy.  
  Usually, index storage will target *indexeddb* â€” though localstorage or cloud storage are options.

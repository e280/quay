# ü™ù Quay

**Quay** is file-browser and outliner ui toolkit for the web. It provides a good user experience for interacting with files, folders, layers ‚Äî any nested tree.

List-view or icons-view. Reorganize with drag-and-drop. Quick-search. Renaming things. Dropping files.

## Quick-start OPFS file browser

Quay is a toolkit that can be used in many different ways.  
In this section, several different intergration examples are provided.  

### HTML technique
1. Install the script into your html `<head>`:
    ```html
    <script type="module">
      import * as Quay from "https://quay.e280.org/install.bundle.min.js"
      const opfs = new Quay.Opfs({allow: ["/"]})
      Quay.register(opfs.components())
    </script>
    ```
1. Place the outliner component anywhere in your html `<body>`:
    ```html
    <quay-outliner></quay-outliner>
    ```
1. Now you're done! Try it out, upload some files and play around.

### Web dev technique
1. Install the package into your project:
    ```sh
    npm i @e280/quay
    ```
1. Put this code into your js/ts app entrypoint (like "main.ts" or something):
    ```ts
    import * as Quay from "@e280/quay"
    const opfs = new Quay.Opfs({allow: ["/"]})
    Quay.register(opfs.components())
    ```
1. Place the outliner component anywhere in your html `<body>`:
    ```html
    <quay-outliner></quay-outliner>
    ```
1. It's ready, take it for a spin!

## Hands-on custom integration

```ts
import * as Quay from "@e280/quay"

const file = Quay.make.file({label: "My cool file"})
const folder = Quay.make.folder({label: "My project", children: [file.id]})

const brain = new Quay.Brain({
  state: new Quay.State({
    rootId: folder.id,
    items: [folder, file],
  }),

  icons: Quay.icons.standard,
  theme: Quay.themes.standard,
  contextMenu: Quay.contextMenus.standard,

  allowSearch: true,
  allowRefresh: true,
  permissions: async item => Quay.permissions.all,

  actions: {
    newFolder: async folder => {},
    move: async move => {},
    search: async search => {},
    delete: async del => {},
    rename: async rename => {},
    refresh: async refresh => {},
    dragAndDrop: async dnd => {},
    upload: async upload => {},
  },
})

Quay.register(brain.components())
```

### Flexible permissions

Let's say you wanted to make a particular folder read-only

```ts
const restricted = Quay.make.folder({label: "Restricted"})

new Quay.Brain({
  ...stuff,

  permissions: async item => {
    if (item.id === restricted.id)
      return Quay.permissions.readOnly
    else
      return Quay.permissions.all
  },
})
```

In this way, you can setup sophisticated rules about what actions are permitted, and under whatever changing circumstances.
